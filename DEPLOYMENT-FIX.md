# Netlify Deployment Fix - Server Actions Issue Resolved

## 🐛 Problem
The build was failing with this error:
```
Server Actions are not supported with static export.
```

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Removed Static Export**
- Removed `output: 'export'` from `next.config.mjs`
- This allows API routes to work properly

### 2. **Converted Server Action to API Route**
- **Removed**: `app/actions/contact.ts` (server action)
- **Added**: `app/api/contact/route.ts` (API route)
- **Updated**: Contact form to use `fetch()` instead of server action

### 3. **Updated Form Handling**
- Changed from `action={handleSubmit}` to `onSubmit={handleSubmit}`
- Updated form submission to use client-side fetch to API route
- Maintained all existing functionality

### 4. **Updated Netlify Configuration**
- Removed static export settings
- Added API route redirects for proper function handling
- Updated publish directory configuration

## 🔧 Files Modified

### `app/page.tsx`
- Removed server action import
- Updated form submission to use API route
- Changed form event handling

### `app/api/contact/route.ts` (NEW)
- API route for handling contact form submissions
- Same email functionality as before
- Proper error handling

### `next.config.mjs`
- Removed `output: 'export'` and `trailingSlash: true`
- Kept other optimizations for Netlify

### `netlify.toml`
- Updated for Next.js API routes
- Added proper redirects for API endpoints

### `app/actions/contact.ts` (DELETED)
- No longer needed with API route approach

## 🚀 Deployment Now Works

Your site will now deploy successfully on Netlify with:
- ✅ Contact form functionality
- ✅ Email notifications via Resend
- ✅ All UI components working
- ✅ Proper API route handling

## 📋 Environment Variables Still Required

Make sure to set these in Netlify:
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Your Resend API key
- `CONTACT_EMAIL` - Email for form submissions

## 🎉 Ready to Deploy!

The build should now complete successfully on Netlify. The contact form will work exactly as before, but now uses API routes instead of server actions.
